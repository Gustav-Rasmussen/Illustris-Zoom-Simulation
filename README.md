# Illustris Zoom Simulation

The main purpose of this project is to analyze the amount of star formation (SFR) taking place between merging galaxies 
(in the so-called 'bridge'), and calculating the ratio of the SFR to the area of the bridge.
This ratio is then compared to the equivalent ratios of each of the two merging galaxies. Next stage will be to evaluate the time evolution of SFR in this area.
